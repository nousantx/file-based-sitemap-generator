# Sitemap Generator

## About

This is a simple code snippet for generating a `sitemap` from `file-based router`. (Tested with [generouted](https://github.com/oedotme/generouted))

You can change the configuration for the generation directly inside the script file. Like changing the domain name, file route extension, and other config.

## Install Dependency

```shell
npm i glob --save-dev
```

## Run the Script

```shell
node generate-sitemap.mjs
```
